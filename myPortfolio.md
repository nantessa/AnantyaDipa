Since March 2021 until July 2021 I'm on the team that handles the Sniper Fury, Disney Gateway Blast, LEGO Legacy: Heroes Unboxed as the core team. I was allocated more to handle the Sniper Fury project as 70% of my priority work time, 15% on Disney Gateway Blast, and 15% LEGO Legacy: Heroes Unboxed. But right now, I'm currently having a new request from a client from LVI that is Despicable Me 2. I was also selected as a key talent after getting this promotion from Junior 2 QA to Senior QA.
